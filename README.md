# Hi there, I'm Kiran Prasad Jamuna Prasad 👋

### 🚀 AI Engineer | Data Scientist | Full-Stack Flutter Developer

I bridge the gap between **Research** and **Production**. I don't just train models in notebooks; I build the **end-to-end ecosystems**—from the mobile apps that collect data, to the cloud pipelines that process it, to the novel Deep Learning architectures that analyze it.

* **📍 Focus:** Generative AI (Agents/RAG), Computer Vision, & Reinforcement Learning.
* **💡 Current Interest:** Agentic Workflows & Physics-Informed Transformers.
* **🛠️ Core Stack:** Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, AWS, Docker.
